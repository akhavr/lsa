The Literature Synthesis Agent is an AI-powered tool designed to
accelerate aging research by automating the retrieval, validation, and
synthesis of scientific literature. Built on ElizaOS, Oxigraph, and
OriginTrail DKG, the agent leverages decentralized knowledge graphs
and blockchain-based validation to ensure transparency and
trustworthiness in its outputs. By integrating SPARQL-driven semantic
search, HyDE query expansion, and automated experiment template
generation, the system enables researchers to efficiently identify
high-impact papers, validate findings via consensus mechanisms, and
translate insights into actionable protocols within SciNote ELN.
